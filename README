# sample-clojure-cloudbees

A good starting point for lein and ring powered clojure apps - for deployment to cloudbees. 

If you don't have one - signup at https://grandcentral.cloudbees.com/account/signup (you can run apps for free on the PaaS - no api restrictions)
The cloudbees plugin (http://clojars.org/lein-cloudbees) is shown here for deployment (no runtime dependency, of course).

## Usage

	lein deps (the first time !)
	lein ring server

This will start the app - and open a browser. Hack away. 
Then go to https://grandcentral.cloudbees.com/user/keys and get your credentials - punch them in (see project.clj). 
You don't need to install anything else (deps will pull down the cloudbees plugin - you can of course install it yourself if you want).

When finished: 
	
	lein cloudbees deploy
	lein cloudbees list-apps
	lein cloudbees

Be happy.
